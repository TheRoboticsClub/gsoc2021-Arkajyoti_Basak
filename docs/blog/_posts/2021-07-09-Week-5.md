# Week 5
> *GSOC Coding Week 5 Progress Report*


This week I started by working in **on-demand logs support for debugging purposes**([issue #1099](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/1099)). The new command to launch RADI can be found in [this](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/1100#issuecomment-874701845) comment. I made a draft PR to fix the **connection timeout** issue([issue #1096](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/1096)). However, I am looking for a better way to solve this problem.

I was also working on **Gazebo FPS decreases since connection establishment**([issue #1098](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/1098)) where I noticed this happens because of the race between gzclient and GUI (and HAL too). Once you turn either off, the other improves. Recently, on-demand gzclient support was added, this definitely improves the fps of the camera images when gzclient is off but does not solve the issue completely.

I made a draft PR to **add automatic evaluators for the drone-cat-mouse exercise**([issue #1121](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/1121)). It uses [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/) to plot the difference between the distances of the cat and mouse drones. Plotly.js is an open-source JavaScript charting library that comes with over 40 chart types, 3D charts, statistical graphs, and SVG maps and more. Also, a score feature was added to evaluate the performance of the cat drone.

I am also attaching the teaser video of Drone Gymkhana exercise:
