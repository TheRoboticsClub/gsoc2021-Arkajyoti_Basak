# Week 6
> *GSOC Coding Week 6 Progress Report*


This week I started by making the teaser videos of 5 drone exercises:
- [Follow Road](https://youtu.be/DdwsbH944M8)
- [Drone Gymkhana](https://youtu.be/68GSXnOTUNs)
- [Visual Lander](https://youtu.be/ScQbVwzqGZA)
- [Drone Cat Mouse](https://youtu.be/0dV8OkTG0pM)
- [Follow Turtlebot](https://youtu.be/r4etz1-pm4k)

I also made few improvements to the Automatic Evaluator for Drone Cat Mouse exercise ([Draft PR](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/1124)). Currently the progress is summarized below:

**Evaluate button:**
- When pressed for the first time it shows a graph plotting the distance between the cat and mouse drone

- **x-axis:** Time in seconds **y-axis:** Distance in metres
- Necessary to submit the code else both the drones will be on the ground and it will plot a horizontal line with dist=0(default value)
- Measuring interval is 2 minutes. On subsequent pressing the button it reduces the measuring interval by 15 seconds each time up to a minimum measuring interval of 30 seconds
- The measuring interval resets each time the user's code is submitted. Press the **Play** and **Evaluate** button sequentially
- In case to stop the plotting press **Stop** button
- The background color of the plot is green and changes to red when dist is greater than 4

**Score:**
- The scoring starts as soon as both the drones are up in the air
**Condition:** both the z values of cat and drone must be greater than 0.25
**Reason:** For fair evaluation
- Necessary to submit the code else the score will be 0(default value)
- **Scoring policy:**
  1. if dist is less than 2 , raise score by 0.5
  2. if dist is more than 2 and less than 3, raise score by 0.25
  3. if dist is more than 3 and less than 4, raise score by 0.12
  4. else not raise score
- **Maximum Score:** 100
- **Measuring interval:** 2 minutes
- The score resets each time the user's code is submitted

The current manager-3.1.py in noetic uses os to run processes. But the os module are now deprecated and replaced by the subprocess module, which is the preferred option in Python 3. Thus, replaced all the os.popen with subprocess.Popen and fixed other bugs in the drone exercises in [PR #1142](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/1142).
