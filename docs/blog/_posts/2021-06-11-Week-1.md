This week I started by creating a new **simple_labyrinth_green** model which is a modified version of the existing **simple_labyrinth** model. I am attaching a screenshot of both the models. Left one is the old model and right one is the new model.

Then I migrated the Labyrinth Escape exercise from ROS-node to Web-template based. The goal of this exercise is to implement the logic that allows a quadrotor to escape a labyrinth through visual signals placed on the ground. Here is a teasor video of the labyrinth escape exercise in web-template:
