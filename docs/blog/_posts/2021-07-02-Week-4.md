# Week 4
> *GSOC Coding Week 4 Progress Report*

This week I started by improving the connection protocol over drone exercises([issue #1021](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/1021)). The issue was manager.py was not waiting for launch.py to finish launching the Gazebo, PX4 SITL, MAVROS in order. So, I have added a temporary text file `status.txt` to solve this. As soon as MAVROS is launched, a new file will be created writing `done`. Until the `status.txt` is created, manager.py will keep on checking for the file every 2 seconds.

The connection protocol for multi-drone exercises(addressed in [issue #1061](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/1061)) is still unsolved. However, `listener actuator_armed -i <topic-instance>` can be used to listen on uORB topics and print the data to the console (more info: [listener](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/middleware/modules_command.html#listener)). The default topic instance is 0. Multi-vehicle simulations use a separate remote port for each instance, allocated sequentially (more info: [mavlink-udp-ports](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/simulation/#default-px4-mavlink-udp-ports)). This needs further discussion and can be used to solve the issue.

This week I also migrated the remaining 3 drone exercises from ROS-node to Web-template based.

- **Drone Gymkhana:** The goal of this exercise is to learn how to control a drone to complete a gymkhana course, composed of several waypoints that youâ€™ll have to navigate through.
- **Drone Hangar:** The goal of this exercise is to implement the logic that allows a quadrotor to escape a hangar filled with moving obstacles.
- **Visual Lander:** The goal of this exercise is to implement the logic that allows a quadrotor to visualize a beacon and land on it.
