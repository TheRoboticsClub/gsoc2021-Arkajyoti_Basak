Google Summer of Code is a global program that connects open-source organizations with student developers. Students spend the summer writing open-source software and connecting with other Google Summer of Code students across the world.

# JdeRobot

JdeRobotâ€™s Robotics-Academy is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises using Python language where the student has to code the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. It uses standard middleware and libraries as ROS and openCV, so the student learn the state of the art tools.

# Project Summary

Currently there are 9 drone exercises available in Gazebo-9 and ROS-melodic. The goal of this project is to migrate the drone exercises from v2.1 (ROS node based) to v2.3 (Web/Docker based) of the Robotics Academy. Introduce a new drone-based exercise: Drone Package Delivery in ROS-noetic and Gazebo-11 and create their requisite gazebo models.
